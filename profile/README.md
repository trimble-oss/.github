## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

### modus-web-components

The [modus-web-components](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com) library provides Modus Elements as, you guessed it, web components! Web components are reusable, encapsulated UI elements that are framework agnostic. This means that whatever framework your UI team uses (angular, react, vue, svelte, etc.) they can leverage the same common components as every other team!

[See it live!](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/) or view the project source at [https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components).
